razer-bw-te-ctl

This program makes it possible to change the configuration of your Razer
BlackWidow Tournament Edition keybooard from within Linux, *BSD or any other
POSIX-compatible system supported by libusb.

Make sure to let the Windows Razer Synapse tool upgrade the firmware to the
newest version before running the program.  There might be some issues otherwise
due to protocol changes, although I don't really deem it very probable.

Run `razer-bw-te-ctl --help' or `man razer-bw-te-ctl' for usage information.

Installation
============
Build dependencies: cmake >= 2.8.5, help2man, libusb >= 1.0

$ git clone git://github.com/pjanouch/razer-bw-te-ctl.git
$ cd razer-bw-te-ctl
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
# make install

Note that there's no "make uninstall".

For Debian-based distros, you can do the following instead of the last step:
$ fakeroot cpack -G DEB
# dpkg -i razer-bw-te-ctl-*.deb

Leave out the fakeroot for CMake >= 2.8.9, it's been fixed since.
